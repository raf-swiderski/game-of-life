  "description": "The Game of life is a zero player game developed in the 70's by John Horton Conway. Check out the Wikipedia article for a full description. The evolving state of the game is determined by the initial configuration - some configurations become infinitely evolving constellations, others eventually evolve into a stable patterns, whilst others die off completely.
